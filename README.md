# AutoHotkey Window Manager

## Overview

This is an AutoHotKey Script I wrote to help manage common window configurations and programs I open on my PC. It's recommended you run with administrative privilege so that you can have it open powershell/git and other tools.

When I use, i put the AHK file on the desktop and right click it.
